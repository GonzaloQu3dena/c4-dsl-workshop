# C4 DSL Workshop

## Summary
<p align="justify">
This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing the C4 model for software architecture using Structurizr DSL. It is designed for educational purposes, allowing exploration from basic concepts to more advanced diagrams like context, containers, components, and even code-level views.
</p>

## What is the C4 Model?
<div>
  <p align="justify">
  The C4 model is a hierarchical approach to visualizing software architecture, composed of four levels:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Context</b> – Shows how your system interacts with users and external systems.</li>
    <li><b>Containers</b> – Details the applications and services (containers) within the system.</li>
    <li><b>Components</b> – Describes the components inside each container.</li>
    <li><b>Code</b> <i>(optional)</i> – Shows class-level or code-level diagrams for deeper technical insight.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

## Tools Used
- [Structurizr DSL:](https://docs.structurizr.com/) A text-based DSL for defining C4 model diagrams.
- [Structurizr Web:](https://structurizr.com/) An online editor where you can paste your DSL files and instantly preview diagrams.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
````bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/c4-dsl-workshop.git
cd c4-dsl-workshop
````
2. Open [Structurizr DSL Editor](https://structurizr.com/dashboard) in your browser.
3. Copy and paste any of the DSL files into the editor to preview the diagrams.
